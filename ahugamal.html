    <h2 class="h1">Animals.</h2> <br>
    <p class="h1">
        I have a passion for animals and everything to do with them and always have. I have also not lived a day in my life where I did not own a pet. I've had everything from a dog to a mouse.<br>
    Currently I have 2 pet bunnies, Hector and Aþena, that I have had since I was 17. I am also a foster home for an Icelandic animal rescue called "Dýrahjálp" and for them I am currently fostering, Þruma, a 7month old female cat. <br>

    My moms boyfriend has sheep that I really enjoy being around, one of them is called Gunnar and is a orphan, when he was newly born I would sit on the barn floor with him and his sister (who unfortunately died)<br>
    snuggled up next to me and feed them bottles, I call him my son even though I don't own a hair on his body. <br>

    <h2 class="h1">Video games</h2>
 
<p class="h1">
    As for video games, those have also been a part of my life for a very long time. My first experience with gaming was playing Mario kart on the Nintendo64. <br>
    From the Nintendo64 I went over to the playstation2, from the playstation2 I went over to the xbox360 and from that I went over to PC gaming. I also have a PS4 now for games exclusive to the PS4 <br>
    but I mostly game on my PC. <br>
    On the second of january this year I discovered my favorite gaming  activity; Role-playing through modded servers. Mainly on GTA but I've recently begun to stick my toe in some DayZ RP. <br>
    I've made a lot of great friends through GTA RP and it has helped me a lot with my social anxiety. I also have 3 characters on the server that I play. One is Victoria North who is a police officer, <br>
    you wouldn't think it is but becoming a police officer on the server is quite the process, you start by applying online through a server hosted website, you then do a interview ICly(in character) and <br>
    OOCly(out of character), the IC interview being to see if your character is viable for the job and the OOC part to see if you know the server rules well enough to RP well. <br>
    After the interviews, and if you make it in, you will have to go through the police academy, it's pretty simple, 4-8 hours depending on how well it goes and how stable the server is and they basically just <br>
    teach you how to do basic things like traffic stops and felony stops, how to PIT cars, going over the handbook etc. <br>

    <br>
    On my most recent character I am the daughter of the leader of the Irish mob on the server, it is one of the oldest player run factions and the biggest. Recently they made a trailer for it to post on the forums <br>
    that you can see here below. <br>
