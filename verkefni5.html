<p class="textium"> Hi my name is Lisa. <br>
    I am 22 years old, born and raised in Iceland. I lived in Reykjavík for the first 8 years of my life but then moved to Bifröst as my mom went to study law there after my parents divorce. <br>
    From the ages of 6 to 15 I went to 6 different schools do to a lot of moving around. <br>
    I have one siblings which is my older brother, he has 8 years on me and has been my hero and role model since I was tiny. <br>
    He moved away from iceland to america about 10 years ago, he's married, has two sons(10 and 4) and is starting is own company. <br>
    I have had a lot of issues with mostly anxiety my whole life but I've been working on getting better for a good long while now and I have definetly shown progress as a couple of years ago <br>
    it got so bad I wouldn't leave the house for months, I couldn't make phone calls or talk to strangers in general but now I go to school and call or talk to who ever I want or need to. <br>
